## Tavern VTT

It's most likely that you're here because you are interested in the [Tavern VTT](https://tavern.works).
I am the solo developer of the VTT, which means I get all of the credit (and all of the blame).
If you'd like to send either my way, you have a few options:

<p style="display: flex; gap: 1rem">Join the Tavern Discord by clicking here: <a href="https://discord.gg/SkjzZVKe2m"><img src="/assets/images/discord.svg" height="20"></a></p>

<p style="display: flex; gap: 1rem">Follow the project on BlueSky: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tavern.works" style="display: flex; gap: 0.25rem"><img src="/assets/images/bluesky.svg" height="20"> @tavern.works</a></p>

Or, if all else fails, you can email me at `stoza@` this website.

## Anything Else

If by some chance you're not here about the Tavern VTT, you're still welcome to email me at the address above
or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-stoza-59914224/).
