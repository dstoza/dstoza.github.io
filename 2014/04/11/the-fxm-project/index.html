<p>Based on the entirely awesome <a href="http://www.homebrewcpu.com">Homebrew CPU</a> project, I decided that it would be fun to
build my own (primarily) 74-series CPU and a computer system around it. I&#39;ve done some preliminary
design, but this is sort of a daunting task, so it&#39;s going to take a while.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like the computer to be fairly well-rounded and as modern as is reasonable for something
hand-built, so my initial list of features looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fairly minimal RISC instruction set (it&#39;s looking rather similar to MIPS right now)</li>
<li>3-stage pipeline

<ul>
<li>Fetch/decode</li>
<li>Register read/execute</li>
<li>Memory/writeback</li>
</ul></li>
<li>32-bit instruction and native word size</li>
<li>8 addressable registers: SP, FP, return address, and some GPRs</li>
<li>24-bit virtual addressing</li>
<li>Modified Harvard architecture (instruction &quot;cache&quot; copies pages from main memory)</li>
<li>Copy-on-write and demand paging</li>
<li>Up to 16MB physical memory, banked for fast memory-to-memory copies</li>
<li>Several expansion slots (MMIO + IRQ lines)

<ul>
<li>Ethernet</li>
<li>UART</li>
<li>Programmable timer</li>
<li>Random number generator</li>
<li>Flash storage</li>
<li>VGA graphics (character mode, not full framebuffer)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>~25MHz to use the system clock to drive VGA</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m currently calling it FXM for the three pipeline stages: <strong>F</strong>etch, e<strong>X</strong>ecute, <strong>M</strong>emory, but
I&#39;m not completely in love with the name, so consider it a codename for now, pending a better name.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to settle on the final instruction set before everything is pinned down, I&#39;m
going to start by creating a simulator in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemC">SystemC</a>. That should help me figure out what
signals I&#39;m going to need and what the general block layout of the system is going to be.</p>
